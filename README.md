# blowup

This package only defines the user-level macro `\blowUp`, which can be used 
to scale all pages of a document up or down. It is similar to the TeX 
primitive `\mag`, but more accurate and user-friendly. `\blowUp` can be 
useful for creating posters from a normal sized document and for many other 
types of fine-tuning of a finished document (e.g., minor scaling changes and 
position of the pages).
